Equinox is a multi-purpose Discord bot meant to satisfy your needs.

This bot contains tons of configuration options and a wide spectrum of features - even an AI chatbot (using Cleverbot)!

Equinox is not only easy to setup and comes "out of the box", but it is also quite fun to play with. Cleverbot, especially.
